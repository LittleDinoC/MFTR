Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Each post represents a TikTok video that uses the specified music ID.\n   - The list would be constrained by the `count` parameter, meaning it would return at most the specified number of posts. The default is 10.\n   - The `offset` parameter determines how many posts to skip before collecting results, allowing for pagination through larger sets of posts.\n\n2. **Post Details**:\n   - Each post in the list would include relevant details, such as:\n     - The post’s unique identifier.\n     - Metadata about the post, such as the user ID or username of the person who created the post.\n     - Information about the music used in the post (such as the music ID, title, or artist).\n     - Engagement statistics like the number of likes, comments, or shares.\n     - URLs or direct links to the post on TikTok.\n\n3. **Pagination Information** (if applicable):\n   - Depending on the `offset` and `count` parameters, the response might also contain metadata about pagination. For example, it could indicate the total number of available posts for that music ID and provide information on whether more posts are available if the user wants to fetch additional results.\n\n4. **Error or Status Information** (if applicable):\n   - If there are any issues with the request (e.g., invalid music ID, too many posts requested), the response might contain error codes or status messages to inform the user of the issue.\n\nThe response would be structured primarily as an array of post objects, possibly with additional metadata about the query (e.g., total available posts or status messages).",

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\").

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.
