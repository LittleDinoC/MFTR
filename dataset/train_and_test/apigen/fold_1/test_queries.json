Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

The response from this tool would likely contain an image or image-related data, possibly in the form of a URL to the generated thumbnail image.\\n\\n### Expected Response Structure:\\n\\n- **image_url**: A string representing the URL to the generated thumbnail image. This URL points to the location where the thumbnail image can be accessed or downloaded.\\n- **refresh_status**: A string indicating whether the thumbnail was newly generated or if it was fetched from cache, especially if a refresh was requested. This would typically indicate whether the \\\"refresh\\\" parameter had an effect.\\n\\n### Meaning of Components:\\n- **image_url**: This is the primary result, providing the location of the newly generated or refreshed thumbnail image.\\n- **refresh_status**: If included, this would clarify whether the thumbnail was a new creation or if an existing cached version was used. This field helps understand whether the refresh request resulted in a new thumbnail being generated.\\n\\nIf the tool supports optional parameters like `refresh`, the response would reflect whether the operation successfully used the refresh feature or not.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\").

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\").

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object.

Your goal is to decompose a user request into a structured multi-field retrieval query that aligns with our tool documentation schema.\n\n# Target Tool Schema\nThe tools you are retrieving are structured as follows:\n- **description**: Formal technical summary of the tool's function.\n- **parameters**: Definitions of required inputs (names, types, roles).\n- **response**: Description of the data returned (entities, status, structure).\n- **examples**: List of `user_intent` strings showing how real users phrase the request.\n\n# Input Context\nYou will be provided with:\n1. **User Query**: The raw user request.\n2. **Partial Tool Descriptions in the Toolset**: A list of potentially relevant tool descriptions retrieved via keyword search. Use these to align your vocabulary with the available toolset.\n3. **Tool View**: A human-friendly flattened view of the tool. This is provided to help you better understand the tool schema.\n\n\n# Your Output Task\nGenerate a JSON object with exactly two top-level fields:\n\n1. **`tool_needs`** (List[Dict]): \n   - Decompose the request into one or more sequential actions. Each dictionary must contain:\n   - `user_intent` (str): A natural language phrasing of this step, optimized to match the **examples** field.\n   - `tool_description` (str): A formal, technical description of the action, optimized to match the **description** field.\n   - `expected_response` (str): An abstract description of the expected data or outcome, optimized to match the **response** field. If no data is returned, write \"Don't need response.\".\n\n2. **`extracted_arguments`** (Dict[str, str]):\n   - A single dictionary containing all parameters extracted from the query.\n   - **Key**: A logical parameter name.\n   - **Value**: An **abstract description** of the parameter's semantic role and data type.\n   - **Constraint**: NEVER include concrete values from the query (e.g., do not write \"Alice\" or \"123\"). Instead, write \"The target username\" or \"Numeric ID\".\n\n# Response Format\nReturn ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown formatting or explanations.\n\n# Example\n\nQuery: \"Find a flight to London and book it for John Doe.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"tool_needs\": [\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"I want to search for available flights to a specific city.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Retrieve a list of flight itineraries based on destination and passenger criteria.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A collection of flight objects containing flight IDs, prices, and schedules.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"user_intent\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"tool_description\": \"Book a ticket for the selected flight using passenger details.\",\n            \"expected_response\": \"A confirmation object including a booking reference number and status.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"extracted_arguments\": {\n        \"destination\": \"The name of the arrival city or airport code.\",\n        \"passenger_name\": \"The full name of the person traveling.\",\n        \"flight_id\": \"A unique identifier for the selected flight itinerary.\"\n    }\n}\n"
