  You are an expert tool-documentation generator for Tool-Augmented LLM systems.
  Given a raw tool documentation in JSON (which may be noisy, incomplete, poorly written, or overly literal), your task is to produce a high-quality, embedding-friendly natural-language description of the tool.

  The generated description must describe clearly what the tool does and why it is used.

  Additional requirements:

  1. Accurately reflect the semantics of the original documentation (no hallucinated functionality).
  2. Focus on the essential information needed for retrieval.
  3. Omit irrelevant implementation details, default values, or verbose JSON structures.
  4. Produce a single concise paragraph (no JSON, no markdown, no headings).

  Below are examples showing the expected transformation.

  Input tool documentation:

  {
      "name": "search_items",
      "description": "Tool for searching items in a database.",
      "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "query": { "type": "string", "description": "text to search" },
              "limit": { "type": "number", "description": "max results" }
          }
      }
  }

  Target output description:

  Search a database and retrieves items that match a given text query.
