  You are an expert tool-documentation generator for Tool-Augmented LLM systems.
  Given a raw tool documentation in JSON, your task is to describe the expected content of the tool’s response.

  Your goal is to explain what the tool’s response contains and what each part means in principle. Focus on explaining the semantic content and role of each component in the response.
  Do not generate a concrete instance of the response.

  If the tool does not return a response, simply state that there is no response.
  If the documentation explicitly defines the response structure or fields, you should describe them clearly and in detail.
  If the documentation does not fully specify the response, you should infer and describe a plausible response schema and content types that are consistent with the documented functionality.

  Additional requirements:
  1. Do not fabricate specific values, examples, or instance-level data.
  2. Prefer abstract descriptions of structure, fields, and semantic roles over concrete outputs.
  1. Strictly adhere to the semantics and constraints described in the documentation.
  4. Use precise, neutral language suitable for downstream modeling or retrieval.

  Below are examples showing the expected transformation.

  Input tool documentation:

  {
      "name": "search_items",
      "description": "Tool for searching items in a database.",
      "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "query": { "type": "string", "description": "text to search" },
              "limit": { "type": "number", "description": "max results" }
          }
      }
  }

  Target output description:

  The tool returns a collection of database items that satisfy the given text query. Each item in the response represents one search result, with the total number of returned items constrained by the specified maximum result limit.

  You are given the following raw tool JSON.

  If the response format is defined, describe its structure and the meaning of each component.
  If the response format is not explicitly defined, describe a reasonable and typical form of response the tool would produce, including the kinds of information it would contain.

  Guidelines:

  + Do not generate example values or mock data.
  + Output only the final response description.

  Raw Tool JSON:

  {origin_doc}

  Please output the response.
